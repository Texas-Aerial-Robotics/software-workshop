  // Write a program that turns a string into "whale talk." Whale talk follows the rules below:
  //
  // 1. There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding the letter y.
  // 2. The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them.
  //
  std::string input = "i live at the aerospace engineering building";

  // Hint 1: make a vector of vowels to reference.
  std::vector<char> vowels;

  // Hint 2: use a double for loop and push_back() calls.

  // Print out the whale talk!
