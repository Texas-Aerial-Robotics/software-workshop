  // Ask the user to input a year, then store the response in an integer.
  
  // Write out the logic for leap year, and tell the user whether or not their
  // input was on a leap year.

  // From Google: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by four, except for
  // end-of-century years. End-of-century years must be divisible by 400 to be
  // leap years. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not. 2024,
  // 2028, 2032, and 2036 are also leap years.
