## Git Configuration

To configure your Git account:

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"`

and 

` git config --global user.email "your.git.email@yourdomain.com" `

This is good to do at the start once you have git installed. More on Git in our Gitbook linked above.

## Linux Package Maintenance

Its good to keep your linux package tool up to date, call it Linux Maintenance. Run:

` sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade `

Occasionally run this command when you are in your Ubuntu environment.
