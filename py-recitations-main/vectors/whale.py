# For Pythons "vectors" AKA lists or arrays (if you see through to using numpy),

# Write a program that turns a string into "whale talk." Whale talk follows the rules below:

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- #
# 1. There are no consonants. Only vowels excluding the letter y.
# 2. The u‘s and e‘s are extra long, so we must double them.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------- #

home =  <Your favorite building at UT> # fill this out

input = f"i live at the {home} building"

# Hint 1: Make a list of vowels
vowels = []

# Hint 2: Look to using nested for loop and append for lists


# Output the result to the user.
