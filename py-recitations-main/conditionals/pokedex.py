# pokedex.py

# Using a match/case, implement a Pokedex that tells the user the name
# (and description, if you'd like!) of the Gen 1 starters and their
# evolutions.

# Research: https://gamerant.com/pokemon-best-starter-trio-ranked/


# NOTE: Now unfortunately, match/case statements are not a thing until Python 3.10 :/,
# so if you are on a version below, do what you have to do.
